Assignment 2 for CPSC 599 - Mixed Reality Apps

Connect to an android device and build from Unity to run
Note: You will need the Android SDK

Using the 3 anchor images, the app will display a Mushroom on the first, rainbow colored image.

Using the accelerometer, move the Mushroom to get it to the second anchor image, the purple swirls. 
Once there, a collision will be triggered that turns on voice commands.

Speak the command "continue" to move forward. Other commands will not work, and it will reprompt you for a voice command as long as you stay on the purple trigger.
If it recognizes "continue" then the accelerometer is disabled, and the Mushroom will look for the third anchor image, the mondrian squares.
Once it makes it to the last anchor, a spin animation is triggered.
